The 1-powerpoint-slide version from work: 
<br>

> James is a senior engineering lead in our Digital practice where he specializes in leading solutions to the most complex technical challenges. With over 25 years of technical and leadership experience across industries, technologies, and cultures, he is able to offer valuable insights to clients. 

> "Technology is changing so fast and the part of my job I enjoy the most is tackling complex problems for clients. Sometimes optimizing the software can improve performance by 1000 percent, or other times we help businesses enable scale through a cloud migration, or improve performance through culture and process insights. Above all, we help our clients to find the best path that is right for them."
 
> James has worked across a broad range of projects at \<work\>. To help clients work more efficiently and innovatively, he often encourages clients to think beyond the technology itself. For example, he recently helped an insurer improve their data engineering culture, so their business teams could collaborate better with their data scientists, which resulted in significant performance improvements within their financial software projects.
 
> “It’s easy to fall into technology cargo cults and misapply technical and organizational trends. It takes the experience gained by using a wide variety of tools in many disparate situations to be able to quickly identify how best to use the resources you have for your project”
 
> James arrived in the UK from Australia many years ago, via a detour for a few years in Finland. He can often be found wandering the hills of some random wilderness, or helping his son with redstone machines in Minecraft. He holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Sydney.

## Key Skills
Software development, strategy, architecture & management. Ability to influence and coordinate across expertise boundaries. Development methods, including scrum/agile. Coding. UI & visualisation design. Product prototyping and iteration. Team leadership. A variety of programming languages ranging from object-oriented to functional, and proven ability to rapidly become productive in new technologies. Recently used languages include [Python](http://xkcd.com/353/), Java, Scala, Clojure, C++, TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust, F# and C#, and they have been used in a range of environments. I have contributed to and initiated open source projects. Also lots of infrastructure and DevOps (Kubernetes, Terraform, etc.)

# Work History
<br>
{{< figure src="/owlogowide.png" >}}

## Senior Lead Engineer | [Oliver Wyman](https://www.oliverwyman.com) | London, UK
### Dec 2016 - now.

LShift (see below) was acquired by Oliver Wyman to form the core of their technology delivery capability. Since then I've been involved in various projects, mostly in the financial space.

- A leader of the evolution of the internal cloud practices from VMs to serverless. Lots of terraform on AWS, some on Azure. Kubernetes in various forms. Communication and consensus building around solutions and best practices.
- Helped a large insurer find a better pattern of work between Data Engineering and Data Science teams. Developed principles and practices to ease interaction, along with code examples. Spark/Databricks.
- Optimised a financial process implemented in python, improving processing time by 800%.
- Helped a bank keep to time by reducing a loan book calculation from 24 hours to 30 minues by distributing a previously monolithic process. python/docker/rabbitmq
- Initial architecture and walking skeleton for a tool to help industries identify actions to mitigate carbon emissions.
- Working to integrate sustainability as an architectural and operational consideration in all software development. Currently evangelising cloud carbon trackers and right-sized infrastructure.
- Tech Lead/Architect etc on [Enki](https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/industries/financial-services/retail-and-business-banking/enki.html) - "A data sharing technology with security in its DNA."

## Senior Developer
### [LShift](https://web.archive.org/web/20160220123718/http://www.lshift.net/) | London, UK
### Nov 2012 – Dec 2016

> "LShift is a hi-tech software development company. It is small but, we like to think, close to perfectly formed. Our company is home to some of the best developers in the UK - not only in our opinion, but in the opinion of a number of international blue chip companies who use our development and research skills."

LShift has been successfully delivering agile projects for blue-chip clients for more than 10 years. They are technology agnostic, preferring to use whatever best delivers business benefit.
Senior Developer is the only developer/architect role in the company, and is unique in that enormous freedom is given to own and direct all aspects of a project (from technical to client relationship), along with enormous responsibility to deliver. Given the exceptional caliber of the staff, this works well.

I joined LShift for the chance to work with such talent (and humour). I did learn a lot of technology, but the most important secret I learned was how to reliably deliver complex projects.
Technologies used so far: Clojure, Go, BigQuery, Scala, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, F#, Docker & Kubernetes, AWS, GCE/GKE, Hadoop, Spark, ElasticSearch, and many more.
- Projects have ranged from data-mining open NHS data to building highly secure messaging platforms.
- Trained in [DSDM](http://www.dsdm.org/) agile project management.

## Research Fellow
### [University of Sydney](http://www.usyd.edu.au) | Sydney, Australia
### May 2012 – Nov 2012

The [Computer Human Adapted Interaction](http://chai.it.usyd.edu.au/) lab conducts research in [ubiquitous computing](http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/UbiHome.html). "We are exploring the technical means by which people can make sense of what it means to ‘own’ and visualise their data in a digital world. We currently focus on e-learning and health." 
Within this role, I was lead architect and developer on a [Personis](http://chai.it.usyd.edu.au/Projects/Personis), a research system offering methods for users to intelligently manage and use their online profile and support [Lifelong User Modelling](http://chai.it.usyd.edu.au/Projects/LLUM). I also led and taught a group of computing science students from one of the most prestigious universities in Australia.

## Software Development Manager
### [University of Sydney](http://www.usyd.edu.au)
### May 1994 – Sep 1999

I was the initial hire in this project, and responsible for the planning and implementation of the entire technology stack, from specifying, installing and running servers (web, sybase, mail, news, proxy, smb, etc) to developing the custom software that made the course possible.

Architect and lead developer of a large-scale, world-leading e-learning platform within the Faculty of Medicine using both client and server side Internet technologies. (Java, Python, JavaScript, SQL)

I invented AJAX in 2000, except it was Java instead of JavaScript (1px applet) and LiveConnect to talk to the JavaScript side 😂. Turns out marketing and having a cool name for the thing is useful!
