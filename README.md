# Some technical notes

Some things I like about how this web site is built:

* It builds instantly
* It deploys instantly
* It has a very limited supply chain
* It loads quickly
* Like `AWK`, the tech is not going to go out of style tomorrow
* I don't pay for anything
* Microsoft doesn't pay for much
* CO2 footprint is minimal

How did I do this? By ignoring the web-app/front-end hype and just using raw html (almost. prism.js for code blocks and some mathjax).
No, it doesn't do everything. No, I can't automatically build indexes, SRO, etc.
I don't need them.

I did go through a `hugo` stage, but too many moving parts and stuff I just didn't need.
