        <h2>The 1-powerpoint-slide version from <a

        <p>
          James is a senior engineering lead in our Digital practice where he
          specializes in leading solutions to the most complex technical
          challenges.
          With over 25 years of technical and leadership experience across
          industries,
          technologies, and cultures, he is able to offer valuable insights to
          clients.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "Technology is changing so fast and the part of my job I enjoy the
            most is
            tackling complex problems for clients. Sometimes optimizing the
            software can
            improve performance by 1000 percent, or other times we help
            businesses
            enable
            scale through a cloud migration, or improve performance through
            culture and
            process insights. Above all, we help our clients to find the best
            path
            that is
            right for them."

        <p>
          James has worked across a broad range of projects. To help
          clients
          work more efficiently and innovatively, he often encourages clients
          to think
          beyond the technology itself. For example, he recently helped an
          insurer
          improve their data engineering culture, so their business teams
          could
          collaborate better with their data scientists, which resulted in
          significant
          performance improvements within their financial software projects.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “It's easy to fall into technology cargo cults and misapply
            technical and
            organizational trends. It takes the experience gained by using a
            wide
            variety of tools in many disparate situations to be able to quickly
            identify
            how best to use the resources you have for your project”
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          James arrived in the UK from Australia many years ago, via a detour
          for a
          few years in Finland. He can often be found wandering the hills of
          some
          random wilderness, or helping his son with redstone machines in
          Minecraft.
          He holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Sydney.

        <p>
          LShift (see below) was acquired by Oliver Wyman to form the core of
          their
          technology delivery capability. Since then I've been involved in
          various
          projects, mostly in the financial space.

          <p>
            LShift is a hi-tech software development company. It is small but,
            we
            like to think, close to perfectly formed. Our company is home to
            some
            of
            the best developers in the UK - not only in our opinion, but in the
            opinion of a number of international blue chip companies who use our
            development and research skills.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          LShift has been successfully delivering agile projects for blue-chip
          clients for more than 10 years. They are technology agnostic,
          preferring
          to use whatever best delivers business benefit.
          Senior Developer is the only developer/architect role in the company,
          and
          is unique in that enormous freedom is given to own and direct all
          aspects
          of a project (from technical to client relationship), along with
          enormous
          responsibility to deliver. Given the exceptional caliber of the staff,
          this works well.

        </p>

        <p>
          I joined LShift for the chance to work with such talent (and humour).
          I
          did learn a lot of technology, but the most important secret I learned
          was
          how to reliably deliver complex projects.
          Technologies used so far: Clojure, Go, BigQuery, Scala, JavaScript,
          TypeScript, C#, F#, Docker & Kubernetes, AWS, GCE/GKE, Hadoop, Spark,
          ElasticSearch, and many more.

        </p>

	Projects have ranged from data-mining open NHS data to building highly secure messaging platforms. A few of note:
        </p>
	<ul>
		<li>A visualisation of pharmaceuticals prescriptions in the UK based on open NHS data</li>
		<li>A ‘Facebook for rich people’, for a startup that didn’t launch. The platform itself was deeply secure and interesting in it’s use of event sourcing and encryption (and so much clojure!)</li>
		<li>A walk-on role in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/weatherwatchers/">BBC Weather Watchers</a></li>
		<li>Various dashboards and tools in D3.js for retail analysis.</li>
		<li>Lead of a project to extract a City Guild system from an AS400. Planned and delivered a transition to a more manageable platform (largely written in F#)</li>
