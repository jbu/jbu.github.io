            I am a seasoned software engineer and architect with over 25 years
            of technical leadership spanning industry and academia. I excel at
            driving sustainable, high‑performance systems from pioneering
            serverless infrastructure to building ML‑powered data platforms. As
            Staff Engineer at Oliver Wyman, I lead projects like a large
            AI-backed financial signal platform (databricks/spark/AWS), and
            initiating transformation in everything from serverless
            infrastructure (AWS/Azure/Kubernetes/Terraform) to LLM usage. I hold
            a PhD in Computer Science.
