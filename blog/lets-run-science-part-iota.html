      Lets Run Science Part Iota

      In our <a href="lets-run-science.html">last jaunt</a>, we had a look at
      code that take
      all the various measurements of temperature that have been taken over the
      last few hundred years, and pull them together into something we can
      usefully run stats on. The headline finding of all this is that on
      average,
      the planet has warmed over time. But why? To answer that, we need a model
      to
      play with.
    </p><p>
      A climate model (or <a
        href="http://www.ipcc-data.org/guidelines/pages/gcm_guide.html)">general
        circulation model</a> attempts
      to model the physical processes of the earths climate. With one of these
      you
      can poke around and see what factors might be causing any changes we're
      seeing. For instance, are changes in the sun causing the warming? Try
      running the model with constant sun and see if the temperature rise goes
      away. It doesn't? Well, it's not the sun. The tl;dr about the models is
      that:
      <ol>
        <li>
          They model the observed climate well (and are constantly getting
          better)
        </li>
        <li>
          The observed warming is only replicated if you take the increase in
          human-generated CO2 into account.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p><p>
      We're not going to get as far as showing that in this post because I'm
      short
      on supercomputers here, but let's at least poke around with the
      technology.
      Since I'm already playing around in the <a
        href="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/">GISS</a>
      website, let's see what we can dig out. For the joy of dusting off
      important
      historic technology, <a href="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/modelii/">Model
        II</a>
      would have been the one to pick, but it's moved onto other pastures, and a
      quick check leaves me unsure if I have the appropriate compiler. So let's
      try their current workhorse,
      <a href="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/modelE/">Model E</a>.
    </p><p>
      To keep things sane, I've set up a gist
      <a href="https://gist.github.com/jbu/ca44dbea0f72e77e627b">here</a> with
      scripts to
      build docker containers etc. You can run it with

      <pre>
      <code class="language-bash">
; curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jbu/ca44dbea0f72e77e627b/raw/modele.sh | bash
; cd modelE
; ./run.sh
</code></pre>
<p>
      Which should run ModelE, with completely generic parameters, from
      1949/12/1 to 1950/12/2. It takes a while!
    </p><p>
      We end up with output in <code class="language-bash">/modelE/decks/my_run</code>. Given the length of the
      run
      there's not much fun to be had here, so I won't try drawing any 1-point
      graphs or anything. But if you're interested there are tools for working
      with the output, documented in the HOWTO
      <a
        href="https://github.com/addinall/GISS_climate_model/blob/master/doc/HOWTO.html#L1315">here</a>.
      If you want to try something more historic,
      <code class="language-bash">/modelE/templates/E_AR5_NINT_oR.R</code> is one of the the rundecks for the
      <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/modelE/ar5/">CIMP5 runs</a>.
    </p><p>
      So, a few random observations about getting modelE going. It's quite well
      documented! (see the <code class="language-bash">/modelE/docs</code> directory). <code class="language-bash">HOWTO.html</code> is a
      comprehensive guide that I'm sure a new post-grad at the group would be
      relieved to see.
    </p><p>
      It mostly consists modules (fortan) that can be assembled to configure a
      particular model. The general work cycle seems to be to think of a way to
      model something (say, the albedo of surf on the sea, or clouds, or
      vegetation), write a module, and write a paper about how you modelled it
      and
      the effect it had (academic publications are the real documentation here).
      There are also publications about how particular runs were configured,
      listing modules used and the initial conditions
      (<a href="http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2014/2014_Schmidt_etal_3.pdf)">example</a>).
      </p><p>
      The codebase has obviously been around for a while, so has vestigial
      traces
      of a number of generations of high performance computing libraries (libMP,
      MPI, etc) and the refactors between them are not complete, but it all
      seems
      well described. 
      </p><p>
        What really strikes me is the 'liveness' of the code.
      It's obviously been worked on heavily for decades, through a bunch of
      technology generations, with multiple owners and different team sizes,
      different thoughts on source code management, modularisation, and even
      languages (although fortran obviously is not going anywhere in this
      space).
      </p><p>
      And a the end of it all, it is sensibly modularised, scales well, uses
      revision control well, has good documentation and from there looks like it
      has reasonable hackability. This almost never happens. I'm quietly
      impressed!
