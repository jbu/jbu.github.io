  <section>

      <p>Last month we took a look at how we might get our location history from Google and show it on a map. We found that the real deal is found at Takeout and consists of a file that's mostly an array of lat/lng/time entries, but with some sort of 'activities' sub-elements sometimes. After a quick glance I just munged it all together and went on, but recently I had another look to check assumptions (radical!). Here's what I found:</p>
  <ol>
  <li class="li1">Sometimes there is also an accuracy, velocity, heading and altitude.</li>
  <li class="li1">The 'activitys' element is a bit of a mystery.
  <ol class="ol2">
  <li class="li1">About 1/3 of entries have one or more of them.</li>
  <li class="li1">Each consisting of a timestamp and then a bunch of 'activities', where activities are like
  <code class="language-json">{"type" : “still”, "confidence" : 100}</code> <p>which looks similar to <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/gms/location/DetectedActivity.html">DetectedActivity</a> from Android</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="p1">There are lots of timestamps</p>
  <pre><code class="language-bash">$ grep timestampMs LocationHistory.json | wc -l
   1045241</code></pre>
  <p>But many are repeats</p>
  <pre><code class="language-bash">$ grep timestampMs LocationHistory.json | sort | uniq -d | wc -l
   611</code></pre>
  <p>I investigated a few of these, and they were something like</p>
  <pre><code class="language-json">    "timestampMs" : "1408910152294","latitudeE7" : xx599,"longitudeE7" : xx279,"accuracy" : 26,
      "activitys" : [ {"timestampMs" : "1408910091630", "activities" : [ yyy ]} ]
    }, {
      "timestampMs" : "1408910091344","latitudeE7" : xx599,"longitudeE7" : xx279,"accuracy" : 26,
      "activitys" : [ {"timestampMs" : "1408910091630", "activities" : [ yyy ]} ]
</code>
  </pre>
  <p>So the 'activity' is at the same time, at the same lat/lng location, but the top-level groups have different timestamps (in this case about a minute apart). I've no idea whey.</p>
  <p>Now, let's start playing with some new hammers I've found to see what we can find that looks like a nail. <a href="http://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a> is my first hammer of the day.</p>
  <p>There are repeated lat/log pairs</p>
  <pre><code class="language-bash">$ jq '.locations[] | [.latitudeE7 , .longitudeE7] | tostring' &lt; LocationHistory.json |  wc -l
   691189</code></pre>
  <p>But again, a number of them are repeated</p>
  <pre><code class="language-bash">$ jq '.locations[] | [.latitudeE7 , .longitudeE7] | tostring' &lt; LocationHistory.json | sort | uniq -d | wc -l
   57649</code></pre>
  <p>So we don't have a particular index. It seems to be just collections of detected activities at a location, at around the same time. And there may be more than one of these clusters for any given location</p>
  <p>Time for another hammer! <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> apparently has a good datatable that we might be able to use. A quick look shows a 1000 page manual, so I actually spent a few train commutes reading. But!</p>
  <pre><code class="language-python">$ ipython --pylab
  &lt;stuff&gt;
  In [1]: from datetime import datetime, timedelta
  In [2]: import math, json, pandas.tools.plotting, urllib2</code></pre>
  <p>First, grab the file</p>
  <pre><code class="language-python">In [3]: j = json.load(urllib2.urlopen("https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/xxxxx/LocationHistory.json"))['locations']
</code></pre>
  <p>Then stick it in an array, with some light conversions. But pull out those activities and add them to the array in their own right. Keep track of numbers of activities and 'activitys' to see what we find. Also track that diff between the group timestamp and activity timestamp.</p>
  <pre><code class="language-python">In [4]: d = []
In [5]: for i in j:
    ...:         r = i.copy() # leave j alone. We will want to re-analyse without having to reload.
    ...:         a = i.get('activitys', [])
    ...:         r['timestampMs'] = int(r['timestampMs'])
    ...:         r['len_activitys'] = len(a)
    ...:         r['longitudeE7'] = float(r['longitudeE7']) / 10**7
    ...:         r['latitudeE7'] = float(r['latitudeE7']) / 10**7
    ...:         r['activities'] = ''
    ...:         r['timestampDiff'] = 0
    ...:         d.append(r)
    ...:         for k in a:
    ...:                     nr = r.copy()
    ...:                     nr['len_activities'] = len(k['activities'])
    ...:                     nr['len_activitys'] = 0
    ...:                     nr['timestampDiff'] = (r['timestampMs'] - int(k['timestampMs']))
    ...:                     nr['activities'] = ','.join([v['type']+':'+str(v['confidence']) for v in k['activities']])
    ...:                     d.append(nr)
    ...:</code></pre>
  <p>Into the dataframe</p>
  <pre><code class="language-python">In [6]: import pandas as pd
In [7]: df = pd.DataFrame(d)
In [8]: df['timestampDiff'] = df['timestampDiff'] / 3600000.0 # make it hours

  <p>Ok. So we see that the timestampDiff is mostly quite small, with huge outliers. But let's start by plotting all the positions in a scatter plot. Here's where I've been &#8211; minimalist style!</p>
  <pre><code class="language-python">In [10]: df.plot('longitudeE7','latitudeE7',kind='scatter', figsize=(6, 4))
Out[10]: </code></pre>
  <p><a href="../static/maplatlng.png">
    <img src="../static/maplatlng.png" /></a></p>
  <p>I'm still interested in those timestamp differences. Let's plot them, against the actual timestamp.</p>
  <pre><code class="language-python">In [11]: df['time'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestampMs'], unit='ms')
In [12]: pldf = df[['timestampDiff', 'time' ]]
In [13]: pldfi = pldf.set_index('time')
In [14]: pldfi.plot()
Out[14]: </code></pre>
  <p><a href="../static/timeplot1.png">
    <img loading="lazy" src="../static/timeplot1.png" /></a></p>
  <p>Outliers. Cut them off and try again.</p>
  <pre><code class="language-python">In [15]: pldfi = pldfi[pldfi.timestampDiff &lt; 150000]
In [16]: pldfi.plot()
Out[16]:</code> </pre>
  <p><a href="../static/timeplot2.png">
    <img loading="lazy"  src="../static/timeplot2.png" /></a></p>
  <p>A little more informative, but only in as much as I can't see a pattern so I'll probably ignore them. Let's check with a histogram.</p>
  <pre><code class="language-python">In [17]: pldfi.hist()
Out[17]: array([[Axes(0.125,0.125;0.775x0.775)]], dtype=object)</code></pre>
  <p><a href="../static/timehist.png">
    <img loading="lazy" src="../static/timehist.png" /></a></p>
  <p>Ok. So mostly small. Well, let's cut the dataset down to a box bounded by slightly outside the two ends of my cycle route. And then save all activities that are onBicycle to a some sort of json thing.</p>
  <pre><code class="language-python">In [18]: lshiftLoc = {'tl':(51.527530, -0.082466), 'br':(51.526702, -0.079849)}
In [19]: wlooLoc = {'tl':(51.504162, -0.114610), 'br':(51.499781, -0.110748)}
In [20]: dfCut = df[(df.latitudeE7 &lt; lshiftLoc['tl'][0])
    ....:           (df.latitudeE7 &gt; wlooLoc['br'][0])
    ....:           (df.longitudeE7 &lt; lshiftLoc['br'][1])
    ....:           (df.longitudeE7 &gt; wlooLoc['tl'][1])]
In [21]: dfBicycle = df[df['activities'].str.contains('onBicycle')]
In [22]: dfBicycle = dfBicycle[['timestampMs', 'latitudeE7', 'longitudeE7']]
In [23]: dfBicycle.index = dfBicycle['timestampMs']
In [24]: dfBicycle = dfBicycle[['latitudeE7', 'longitudeE7']]
In [25]: dfBicycle = dfBicycle.iloc[len(dfBicycle)::-1]
In [26]: dfBicycle.to_json('bicycles.json')</code></pre>
  <p>Which then fails because the index (timestampMs) is not unique. Ok. Time to stop and eat.</p>
  <p>So, what have I accomplished? I learned a bit about some tools. I learned almost nothing about the LocationHistory format.</p>
  <p>&lt;rant&gt;</p>
  <p>I think that google takeout is an awesome thing. That sort of openness and non-stickyness from a large company is unusual, and to be applauded. And mostly they seem to be sticking with well known file formats that are documented and can be re-used in other services, but not with location history. I'm guessing it's just a combination of a lack of common file formats to choose from coupled with a developer's love of writing documentation, rather than whatever motivated Microsoft to produce .docx. But if someone on the inside could throw us a note about what it's all about, that'd be really nice.</p>
  <p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>
