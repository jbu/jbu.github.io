      Playing with open NHS data, and a rant

      Open Data™ is being pushed quite heavily by the powers that be, which is
      mostly a good thing because It's useful information that I want to use,
      and I've already paid taxes for it. Also, this is a democracy dammit. Can
      Haz Sunlight!. The NHS is part of this. For most of this post we will look
      at the published sets of prescription data, but see <rant> below. And
        we're going to look at how to use some open information about U.K.
        postcodes to homogenise the data across a big reorganisation of the NHS.
      </p><p>
        <a href="http://www.hscic.gov.uk/gpprescribingdata">The data</a>,
        published monthly, is a list what drugs each GP practice has prescribed
        that month. So when you are prescribed your Penicillin by your GP, that
        goes into the list that says, at the end of the month, your GPs practice
        prescribed 57 courses of Foo-brand penicillin capsules at a cost to the
        NHS of £120 (or whatever).
        <ul><li>
            Each practice has a Practice ID. An ancillary .csv file published
            with the main data links each practice ID that is contained in the
            month's data to a practice name and address including postcode. The
            IDs seem to be pretty stable across name changes and small office
            moves.
          </li><li>
            The medicines are coded according the <a
              href="http://www.bnf.org/bnf/index.htm">British National Formulary</a>
            (BNF). The codes in these files are at the 'presentation' level,
            which is the most specific. So if we wanted to find out about just
            'penicillin' we roll up all the different brands and packagings of
            penicillin to the 'chemical' level of the BNF.
          </li><li>
            Each practice is also part of a regional grouping. Before about
            April 2013, this was the 'Primary Care Trust' (PCT). Now it's the <a
              href="http://www.england.nhs.uk/resources/ccg-directory/">'Clinical
              Commissioning Group (CCG)'</a>.
          </li></ul>
          </p><p>
        So, let's say you want to look at how much penicillin was prescribed in
        CCG Ealing as far back as we have data. How do we convert those old PCT
        groupings into CCGs?
      </p><p>
        Getting most of the way there is not so hard. Start with the data we
        have that uses CCGs, and for each practice ID we have with a CCG, use
        that in the old PCT data. But there are practices that don't appear in
        the new data (they might have been closed before then for instance). Now
        things get a bit more tricky, and we have to start playing around.
      </p><p>
        It might be tempting to find a map of the <a
          href="http://www.england.nhs.uk/resources/ccg-maps/">CCG boundaries</a>,
        use some geolocation service to find a latitude and longitude of all
        practices (over a period of a few days because we don't want to pay for
        a commercial API key), and convert accordingly.
      </p><p>
        But that's harder than
        necessary. What sort of idiot would do that? he asks rhetorically,
        particularly when it turns out that the Office of National Statistics
        publishes, among a whole pile of other handy things, a little data set
        called the <a
          href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/products/postcode-directories/-nspp-/index.html">ONS
          Postcode Directory</a> that links all these things together. It's
        actually a list of all the sub-regions used by the ONS, mapped to their
        postcode and bunch of other administrative regions, which happen to
        include, if you find the right file, both the current CCG and the old
        PCT. And a practice has a postcode, so we now have a postcode/CCG/PCT
        mapping. yay!
      </p><p>
        It doesn't get us all the way there, because postcodes seem to change
        more regularly than you'd think, and the post office is the canonical
        owner of postcodes, not the ONS, and some organisations (like CCGs and
        PCTs) have weird off-map postcodes. But we've achieved a good balance
        between 100% and done.
      </p>
      <h2> &lt;rant&gt; </h2>
      <p>
        We're straying into uncharted social waters with some of this data,
        and we really don't know what we're doing. This particular dataset is
        probably ok, in that it's to do with the finances of a public body on
        the one hand (transparency) but doesn't betray the confidences of that
        same public. Unless of course you're the only person at a GP that
        takes a rare prescription, and people can guess that from your address
        and some public knowledge about your health.
      </p><p>
        As for how this data set is collected, I really don't know. It's drawn
        from the whole prescription payment system which is labyrinthine. I've
        no idea if there is a point in the chain where my entire prescription
        history is stored. If so, I've no idea how it's stored, or whether it
        might be <a
          href="hhttps://www.mysociety.org/2014/12/20/another-private-data-leak-this-time-by-hackney-council/">accidentally
          released in an FOI request</a>, or how likely a Sony Pictures-like
        scenario is. And this is the underbelly of centralisation of data.
        Yes, you can do big-data analysis of whatever which might help with
        medical research or spotting public health trends. But it's easier to
        compromise a single system than all the massively heterogenous GP
        systems. Apparently the ONS has this in hand, so things like census
        data are well cared for. They tend towards the 'Tower of London'
        approach of keeping all the eggs in one basket and then guarding the
        basket well. Other researchers can still use the data, but there's an
        ethics system in place to vet the analyses and use.
      </p><p>
        But more than this, <a
          href="http://theodi.org/lunchtime-lectures/friday-lunchtime-lecture-why-selling-peoples-medicaltaxschool-records-isnt-open-data">apparently</a>
        some are still thinking that identifiable medical records might be a
        revenue stream. Sort of the NHS taking on the Facebook business model.
        Let's not do that.
