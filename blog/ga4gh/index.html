It’s no longer in the wild ride of 2008, but still the cost is now low enough that genome data is piling up in research centres the world over.

It was a short project, but great fun working with an excellent and committed global team on a solid codebase, and contributing good plumbing to some of the most important science going on. We enjoyed it so much we <a href=http://www.lshift.net/about/news/lshift-joins-ga4gh/>joined</a>, and look forward to contributing more in the future.</p><p>(Originally <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20161006152309/http://www.lshift.net/blog/2015/08/11/global-alliance-for-genomics-and-health/>http://web.archive.org/web/20161006152309/http://www.lshift.net/blog/2015/08/11/global-alliance-for-genomics-and-health/</a>)</p></section><section><footer class=page-footer><hr><div class=previous-post style=display:inline-block><a class=link-reverse href="https://uther.wtf/blog/signal-strength/?ref=footer">« Signal Strength</a></div><div class=next-post , style=display:inline-block;float:right><a class=link-reverse href="https://uther.wtf/blog/the-life-changing-magic-of-refactoring/?ref=footer">The Life Changing Magic of Refactoring »</a></div><ul class=page-footer-menu><li><a href=https://twitter.com/hemul><i class="fab fa-twitter fa-lg"></i></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/jbu><i class="fab fa-github fa-lg"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AquEEvUAAAAJ"><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap la-lg"></i></a></li></ul><div class=copyright><p>&copy; 2022
