      Gene sequencing has been diving in cost:

      It's no longer in the wild ride of 2008, but still the cost is now low
      enough that genome data is piling up in research centres the world over.
      It's been realised that a lot of the really interesting research questions
      can only be answered by sampling a wide range of data from a wide range of
      research centres. Unfortunately, they all store the data in custom
      formats,
      with individual access policies, processes, procedures and protocols, so
      some of the most promising medical research is being slowed or prevented
      by
      an inability to share data.
    </p><p>

      <a href="http://genomicsandhealth.org/">The Global Alliance for Genomics &
        Health</a>
      (GA4GH) works to overcome this by defining interoperable standards, sort
      of
      like the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> of genomics.
    </p><p>

      The <a href="http://ga4gh.org/#/">Data Working Group</a> is developing an
      <a href="http://ga4gh.org/#/documentation">API</a> and <a
        href="https://github.com/ga4gh/server">reference
        implementation</a> of a server for sharing
      genomic data, and approached LShift to help with a few bits and bobs;
      adding
      OpenID Connect support so that sensible authentication can be configured,
      a
      sphinx plugin for documenting apache avro schemas, and some performance
      improvements. It was a short project, but great fun working with an
      excellent and committed global team on a solid codebase, and contributing
      good plumbing to some of the most important science going on. We enjoyed
      it
      so much we <a href="http://www.lshift.net/about/news/lshift-joins-ga4gh/">joined</a>,
      and look forward to contributing more in the future.
