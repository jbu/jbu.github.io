      An NFR is broadly defined as a 'quality' of the software, rather than what
      it 'does'. So 'the software shall add two numbers' is a functional
      requirement, while 'the software shall run within two minutes' or 'the
      software shall be maintainable', or 'scalable', or whatever, is deemed
      'non-functional'. I submit that this is a dangerous distinction to make
      when running a software project.
    </p><p>
      In the large, everything is functional. This has been formalised into <a
        href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com">Hyrum's Law</a>: <blockquote><p>“With a sufficient
      number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the
      contract: all observable behaviours of your system will be depended on by
      somebody.”</p></blockquote>

      I've noticed that if you call something 'non-functional' it immediately
      becomes deprioritised, a tier two requirement. What people hear is <i>“this
      would be nice to have but we don't think anyone important actually cares
      much about it.”</i>
    </p><p>
      As an example from <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement">Wikipedia</a>,
      take performance requirements. They say that 'software shall run in time
      X' is a non-functional requirement. Well, it's not important until it is.
      If there are no deadlines, there is no problem. Is it even a requirement?
      But if your software has to process a bank's worth of securities in two
      hours, it is a requirement. 'Non-functional', my horse.
    </p><p>
      The <b>danger</b> of reflexively saying 'it's performance, that's
      non-functional' is the team doesn't pay attention to it until too late.
      Just eliminate the category.
