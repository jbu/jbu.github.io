        Lunchtime hack: My cycling routes

        <p>Like most Android users (because I think it's the default) Google
          tracks my location.
          Thankfully, they provide a way for me to view and edit the data
          collected (Thus satisfying some
          major rules of personal data collection - well done!). But the
          interface on location history
          is clunky as a visualisation, so let's spend lunch seeing if we can do
          better.</p>
        <p>We start at the data -<a title="Location History"
            href="https://maps.google.co.uk/locationhistory/"> Location History</a>
          and our first discovery is that since the closure of Latitude, the API
          to the data has been removed.
          We're left with a 'download KML' link that will allow you to download
          a maximum of 30 days data at a time.
          Grrr. Anyway, let's get the data for the last month.</p>
        <p>A really quick way of seeing what we have is to simply drag the .kml
          file into Google Earth.
          It even gives a nice time range selection widget, and a kind of fading
          effect where points outside the
          selected time are dimmed but not hidden altogether. So here's a
          relatively nice overview of my various
          cycle routes between Waterloo and LShift:</p>
        <p><a href="../static/"><img
              src="../static/Screenshot_082614_102701_AM.jpg"/></a></p>
        <p>If we do select the entire time range it gets a bit messy, and that's
          about all we can do with Google Earth:</p>
        <p><a href="../static/Screenshot_082614_102756_AM.jpg">
            <img loading="lazy" 
              src="../static/Screenshot_082614_102756_AM.jpg"/></a></p>
        <p>In the drive to replace Earth with Maps, it turns out that Google
          have added similar capabilities
          to Maps (<a
            href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/235/display-a-local-file-in-google-maps">a
            good
            overview here</a>). Again, it's limited. We can style the map a bit
          more, but we can't style the location
          data in any meaningful way.</p>
        <p><a href="../static/Screenshot_082614_102756_AM.jpg"><img
              loading="lazy" src="../static/Screenshot_082614_103618_AM.jpg"/></a></p>
        <p>Where else can we go?</p>
        <p>Fusion tables supposedly has a nice KML layer and heatmaps. But a
          quick try shows that it doesn't understand some new
          elements (the <a
            href="https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference#gxtrack">gx:Track</a>
          element) in the KML, so no go there.</p>
        <p>The javascript maps API has a nice heatmap layer (<a
            href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/heatmaplayer">docs</a>)
          that
          looks like it will do a good job, so let's give that a go. Upload the
          KML to a public dropbox folder, grab the public URL of the file, head
          over to jsfiddle and build a $.get that retrieves the file, grabs the
          gx:coord elements, builds up an array of points that can be consumed
          by the heatmap layer,
          and um, nothing much. BUT then you realise that there is heat around
          work and home and perhaps the intensity is being scaled depending on
          frequency which is
          leaving the less-travelled places too dim, so you set maxIntensity to
          1: TaDa!</p>
        <p><img loading="lazy" src="../static/Screenshot_082714_011252_PM.jpg"/></p>
        <p>Here's the code. And no, this won't work because I've removed my
          location history for obvious reasons. But try substituting your own
          (edit in <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/zwc5qLna/">jsfiddle</a>)</p>
        <p><pre>
          <code class="language-javascript">
$(document).ready(function () {
  $.get("https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2<xxx>/history-07-27-2014.kml", {
    dataType: 'xml'
  }, function (data) {
    var heatmapData = [];
    $(data).find("coord").each(function (i, e) {
      var h = $(e).html().split(' ');
      heatmapData.push(new google.maps.LatLng(parseFloat(h[1]), parseFloat(h[0])));
    });

    var london = new google.maps.LatLng(51.515, -0.101);

    map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map-canvas'), {
      center: london,
      zoom: 15,
      mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.STREET
    });

    var pointArray = new google.maps.MVCArray(heatmapData);

    var heatmap = new google.maps.visualization.HeatmapLayer({
      data: pointArray,
      maxIntensity: 1
    });
    heatmap.setMap(map);
  })
});
</code>
          </pre></p>

        <p>
          Then I realise that <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/takeout">Takeout
          </a>allows you to download location history data, so kick that off,
          but it's very asynchronous, so back to work and we'll have a look
          tomorrow.</p>
        <h2>Next lunch:</h2>
        <p>So Takeout gives you all your data, with more attributes (accuracy
          and a guess as to activity type) in a big json file. Let's upload that
          to dropbox. It's a fair size so come back after a cup of tea.</p>
        <p>It mostly boils down to lots of</p>
        <pre>
<code class="language-json">
{
  "timestampMs" : "1409036497572",
  "latitudeE7" : xx1453,
  "longitudeE7" : -xx934,
  "accuracy" : 30
}
</code>
</pre>
        <p>chunks, embedded in various arrays which represent who-knows-what,
          and where l*E7 seems to be the value multiplied by 10**7. We want to
          grab all the chunks in what looks like a shallow structure - how about
          underscore and _.flatten?</p>
        <p>Off to jsfiddle again. Back to a text editor because playing in
          jsfiddle with a 150Mb file is not that easy, so cut the file down to a
          small amount of test data. And the initial results look good. Change
          the <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/snufk1n/7n2vwzvk">fiddle</a> to the
          full data set thusly:</p>
        <pre>
<code class="language-javascript">
$(document).ready(function () {
  $.getJSON("https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/<xxx>/LocationHistory.json", function (data) {
      var heatmapData = _.flatten(data)
          .filter(function (i) {
              return i.hasOwnProperty('timestampMs');
          })
          .map(function (c) {
              return new google.maps.LatLng(
                  parseFloat(c.latitudeE7) / 10000000, parseFloat(c.longitudeE7) / 10000000);
          });

      var london = new google.maps.LatLng(51.515, -0.101);
      map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map-canvas'), {
          center: london,
          zoom: 15,
          mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.STREET
      });

      var pointArray = new google.maps.MVCArray(heatmapData);
      var heatmap = new google.maps.visualization.HeatmapLayer({
          data: pointArray,
          maxIntensity: 1
      });
      heatmap.setMap(map);
  });
}); 
</code>           
          </pre>

        <p>Aaand: A right mess.</p>
        <p><img loading="lazy" 
            src="../static/Screenshot_082814_124101_PM.jpg"/></p>
        <p>So, too much data to be useful now. We could go and start filtering
          by these 'activities' (or 'activitys' depending on which googler wrote
          which part of the json marshaller it seems) and finding the cycling
          ones. Or there is a way of weighing data points that we could tie in
          with the accuracy measure. But it's time to eat.</p>
