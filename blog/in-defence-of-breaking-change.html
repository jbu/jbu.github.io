      For the purposes of this post let's assume it's simply rubbish.
    </p>

    Received wisdom is that breaking changes to supporting software (OS,
    libraries, services, etc) is bad. This makes intuitive sense. An API is a
    contract, and contracts are to be honoured.
  </p><p>
    We have <a href="https://semver.org/">SemVer</a> to attempt to manage changes. Rich
    Hickey thinks that SemVer is wrong, and you should <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk">just accrete</a>. Platform providers go
    to great lengths to let you keep running your broken software. Here's some
    Microsoft <a href="http://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321440303/samplechapter/Chen_bonus_ch01.pdf">war stories</a>.
    And of course, Linus has <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75">an opinion</a>
    (and is working on expressing his opinions in a more constructive way).
  </p><p>
    But there's a hold out. Recently Steve Yegge had a
    <a href="https://medium.com/@steve.yegge/dear-google-cloud-your-deprecation-policy-is-killing-you-ee7525dc05dc">rant</a>
    about how google keeps ignoring this sensible consensus. And we all know
    that's true. Just try saying 'google reader' to a bunch of engineers and
    feel the wave of unresolved loss, and that's for a free service, not a paid
    and supported API. But why does Google do that? Now, the first law of
    software engineering is “You are not Google”. You do not have a magic money
    machine in the basement and a good percentage of engineering talent working
    for you (If you do, DM me). It turns out that internally they use that money
    and talent to do things the hard, right way (sometimes).
  </p><p>

</span>
. Google
    faced the fact that things change, and that <i>“Software Engineering is
    Programming integrated over time”</i>. Getting a program to run once is
    programming. Getting it to keep running when the OS gets upgraded, the team
    changes, requirements change, dependencies are upgraded, laws change,
    businesses change, […] is engineering. For good software to remain good
    software into the future the code must be malleable and deployable.
  </p><p>
    Let's narrow this to managing dependencies. Managing versioning between
    modules is a problem that scales quadratically, and is worse than you think
    given <a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrum's law</a> that in the limit there is
    no such thing as a private interface. In the Google case, it's their code
    and they can tackle the problem at the root. Their solution seems to be
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tISy7EJQPzI">'live at head'</a>.
    It ideally goes something like this:
  </p><p>
    <ul>
      <li>everything is comprehensively covered by automated testing</li>
      <li>a module is published (and it's all public interface, see Hyrum's Law)</li>
      <li>it becomes widely used</li>
      <li>a new version is published. It breaks a test somewhere.</li>
      <li>a decision is made whether to fix the module, or fix the consumer</li>
      <li>if many consumers will break, and they all need to be fixed, a tool is shipped to automate the fix given it's all in an obsessively tested monorepo the change is shipped when 'google works with this change'</li>
      <li>the tail of supported versions is therefore very short, if it exists at all</li>
      <li>A relatively recent presentation “Live at Head“: gives a far more authoritative view.</li>
    </ul>

  </p><p>
    In essence, the contract changes from <i>“We will not break the contract”</i> to
    <i>“We might break the contract but will provide good tools/docs (perhaps API
    credits?) to assist migration.”</i>
  </p><p>
    Now the point of the Yegge rant above is that Google is <b>not</b> doing this
    reliably in the public APIs. It's hard! But let's assume the utopia. What
    would a software project that uses these 'live at head' APIs look like?
    There seem to be a few things that are necessary:
  </p><p>
    <ul>
    <li>the engineering is live, as in there is institutional memory about how to
    make changes and get them into production</li>
    <li>the code is well provisioned with automated tests</li>
    <li>there is a live CI system that speculatively upgrades dependencies</li>
    <li>if a test breaks because of a dependency upgrade there is someone who can
    step in to investigate</li>
    <li>the step above is much simpler if the code is regular enough to allow
    automated upgrade tools to work. Newer languages like 'Go' are designed with
    this in mind</li>
  </ul>
  </p><p>
    This is not a big investment, and well worth it. But it is a change of
    mindset. A software project from an enterprise would not just hand over a
    binary. They wouldn't even just hand over a service and a monthly AWS bill.
    The project would involve setting up and leaving behind (or maintaining &dash;
    for a reasonable consideration) the engineering capability listed above. In
    return, the customer would have software that has all the latest security
    patches, performance improvements, and so forth, and whoever is running the
    service would have the capability to optimise runtime platforms etc. That's
    a win/win from where I'm standing.
