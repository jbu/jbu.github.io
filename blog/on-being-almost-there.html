      On Being Almost There

      <a href="http://chai.it.usyd.edu.au/Projects/Personis">Personis</a> is an
      ongoing line of research projects about how we can store personal data
      (thing location tracking, fitness trackers, etc) in a way that leaves us
      in control of our data but at the same time allows us to give permission
      to useful services to process that data for us. A canonical example would
      be something like:

      <figure>

          width="600"/>
      </figure>
    </p><p>
      In which location and activity data are co-located somewhere which gives
      us ownership of that data and the ability to repurpose it. In this case
      location (track.er) and movement (pedomet.er) services are feeding data
      into personis, and HipsterFitnessVisualisat.ion (H25n).
      <label for="sn-anything" class="margin-toggle margin-number"/>&#8853;</label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="sn-anything" class="margin-toggle" />
      <span class="marginnote">I don't know if .er, .ce, .cha or .ion are valid gTLDs but given
        that ICANN seem to be just feeding a scrabble dictionary into the root
        servers, they will be soon.</span>
      Google is using the data to show groovy single-origin-latte-splattered D3 animations of my
      lack of health.
    </p><p>
      Research themes might be around is Personis a data store or broker? What
      are the implications for me when I allow H25n into my data? What are
      useful ways of presenting these implications so I can make an informed
      choice? What APIs work best?
    </p><p>
      Anyhoo, this isn't a story about that. But I once added Oauth2 support to
      the personis server. It was an unusual configuration in that the server
      was both an Oauth client and server. See, in the setup above, the personis
      server could obviously be an Oauth server, in that H25n registers as a
      client and needs to authenticate against it with credentials for the user
      (as could the location and activity feeders). However, we don't want to
      handle passwords, so the personis server wants to delegate that to someone
      (E.G. Google), and so becomes an Oauth client as well. The user agent
      dance is similar to a normal Oauth login, but extended as H25n pass the
      user on to the personis server for authentication, who then passes them
      onto google as another layer of delegation. User provisioning was
      similarly extended. So when a new user goes to H25n, the flow might go:
      <ul>
        <li>End user browses to H25n to view their lack of measurable health</li>
        <li>H25s bounces the browser to Personis asking to authenticate the
          user, and to know some user details (name, photo etc)</li>
        <li>Personis bounces the browser to google asking to authenticate the
          user, asking for the same userinfo items.</li>
        <li>Google does the login and permission screens (for access to the
          userinfo) and bounces the browser back to personis with an auth token</li>
        <li>Personis checks the received auth token with google via a
          backchannel. If it works and an access token is granted (and hence
          personis has permission for this) it asks for the userinfo as well and
          stores that. If the user has not been seen by personis before, a new
          user datastore is created. The user is then asked if they are OK for
          H25n to use this datastore. If so, the browser is then bounced back to
          H25n with an auth token.</li>
        <li>H25n checks the received auth token with personis via a backchannel
          and if it works pulls over the user info and off it goes with a newly
          provisioned user.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      Simple
    </p>
    <p>
      So that's where it stood. But now we have <a
        href="http://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a>, with it's fancy <a
        href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2013/04/04/ID-Tokens">JWT
        tokens</a> which can contain signed claims about the user, and
      apparently:

      <blockquote>
        <p>
        One thing that makes ID tokens useful is that fact that you can pass
        them around different components of your app. These components can use
        an ID token as a lightweight authentication mechanism authenticating the
        app and the user.
        <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect#validatinganidtoken">link</a>
      </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      So my question of the day is, can the new OpenID Connect tricks help clean
      up the above flow?
    </p><p>
      Well, in the Android world, there is a common pattern that looks a bit
      like this. You'd have an app that talks to a web service, that talks to
      google. So the Kombu.cha, the social app for hand-made sandal enthusiasts,
      will talk to it's associated web site, but might use Google for auth
      again. <a
        href="http://android-developers.blogspot.co.uk/2013/01/verifying-back-end-calls-from-android.html">Here's</a>
      how the kombu.cha app and site can use these tricks to access a google API
      (and incidentally how google solved the horrid user experience of Oauth on
      Android and iOS):
      <ul>
        <li>At google, you set up a project, and in that get an Oauth client id
          for your web service, and another for your android app.</li>
        <li>The app uses GoogleAuthUtil to get an ID token from google using
          it's client id, but the token has a wrinkle in that the it asks for an
          `audience:server:client_id:<web app id>` scope as well, and thus
            includes your web service as a scope, and the 'azp' (authorised
            party I suppose) is the client ID of your app. This means that
            google has signed something saying that it thinks that the person to
            which the ID token relates has authorised correctly to google via
            the said app, and that they are happy for the app to access the web
            service. </li>
          <li>When the app wants to use it's associated web service, it sends
            the token along with the request. The service then validates that
            the token is signed by google, has the correct audience and azp, and
            can take that as proof that the user is all good.</li>
          </ul>
          </p><p>
        Can we use this to clean up the original Personis flow? It might look
        something like:
      <!-- </p> -->
        <ol><li>
        H25n bounces the browser to google, with a scope that includes the
        client id for the personis service (which would need to be published
        somewhere).
      </li><li>
        The user would be asked to OK something like 'I agree that
        HipsterFitnessVisualisat.ion can access data from PersonisServi.ce', and
        then bounces back to H25n with an access token.
      </li><li>
        H25n can then use the access token to get an ID token, with appropriate
        audience and azp fields, and signature.
      </li><li>
        H25n sends a request to personis that includes the ID token. After
        appropriate checks, personis knows that google believes that the user
        has authorised H25n to access personis (phew!). There is the small
        matter of how personis knows that it's H25n doing the requesting, but
        perhaps we can rely on them having the ID token in the first place (In
        fact you can't trust this in the android flow above either, because the
        device might be rooted).
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p><p>
        And here's where we hit the limits of the spec. Although Google has made
        the Android flow work, extending it to arbitrary web services is
        off-piste. But let's give it a quick go at the Oauth2 playground. Create
        a google project for personis and generate appropriate Oauth client IDs.
        Enter our <code class="language-bash">audience:server:client_id:&lt;web app id&gt;</code>
          <pre>
            <code class="language-bash">
Error, scope unknown.
</code></pre>
</p><p>
          So no.
