So ‘the software shall add two numbers’ is a functional requirement, while ‘the software shall run within two minutes’ or ‘the software shall be maintainable’, or ‘scalable’, or whatever, is deemed ‘non-functional’. I submit that this is a dangerous distinction to make when running a software project.</p><p>In the large, everything is functional (This has been formalised into <a href=https://www.hyrumslaw.com>Hyrum’s Law</a>: <em>“With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all observable behaviours of your system will be depended on by somebody.”</em>)</p><p><a href=https://xkcd.com/1172/><img src=https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/workflow.png alt="There are probably children out there holding down spacebar to stay warm in the winter! YOUR UPDATE MURDERS CHILDREN."></a></p><p>I’ve noticed that if you call something ‘non-functional’ it immediately becomes deprioritised, a tier two requirement. What people hear is <em>“this would be nice to have but we don’t think anyone important actually cares much about it.”</em></p><p>As an example from <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement>Wikipedia</a>, take performance requirements. They say that ‘software shall run in time X’ is a non-functional requirement. Well, it’s not important until it is. If there are no deadlines, there is no problem. Is it even a requirement? But if your software has to process a bank’s worth of securities in two hours, it is a requirement. ‘Non-functional’, my horse.</p><p>The <em>danger</em> of reflexively saying ‘it’s performance, that’s non-functional’ is the team doesn’t pay attention to it until too late. Just eliminate the category.</p><p>(originally version - <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20201023212029/https://tech.labs.oliverwyman.com/blog/2020/08/27/nfrs-considered-harmful/>http://web.archive.org/web/20201023212029/https://tech.labs.oliverwyman.com/blog/2020/08/27/nfrs-considered-harmful/</a>)</p></section><section><footer class=page-footer><hr><div class=previous-post style=display:inline-block><a class=link-reverse href="https://uther.wtf/blog/application-patterns-for-the-outernet/?ref=footer">« Application Patterns for the Outernet</a></div><div class=next-post , style=display:inline-block;float:right><a class=link-reverse href="https://uther.wtf/blog/in-defence-of-breaking-change/?ref=footer">In Defence of Breaking Change »</a></div><ul class=page-footer-menu><li><a href=https://twitter.com/hemul><i class="fab fa-twitter fa-lg"></i></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/jbu><i class="fab fa-github fa-lg"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AquEEvUAAAAJ"><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap la-lg"></i></a></li></ul><div class=copyright><p>&copy; 2022
