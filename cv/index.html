With over 25 years of technical and leadership experience across industries, technologies, and cultures, he is able to offer valuable insights to clients.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Technology is changing so fast and the part of my job I enjoy the most is tackling complex problems for clients. Sometimes optimizing the software can improve performance by 1000 percent, or other times we help businesses enable scale through a cloud migration, or improve performance through culture and process insights. Above all, we help our clients to find the best path that is right for them.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>James has worked across a broad range of projects at &lt;work>. To help clients work more efficiently and innovatively, he often encourages clients to think beyond the technology itself. For example, he recently helped an insurer improve their data engineering culture, so their business teams could collaborate better with their data scientists, which resulted in significant performance improvements within their financial software projects.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“It’s easy to fall into technology cargo cults and misapply technical and organizational trends. It takes the experience gained by using a wide variety of tools in many disparate situations to be able to quickly identify how best to use the resources you have for your project”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>James arrived in the UK from Australia many years ago, via a detour for a few years in Finland. He can often be found wandering the hills of some random wilderness, or helping his son with redstone machines in Minecraft. He holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Sydney.</p></blockquote><p>More info:</p><h2 id=key-skills>Key Skills<a class=anchor href=#key-skills>#</a></h2><p>Software development, strategy, architecture & management. Ability to influence and coordinate across expertise boundaries. Development methods, including scrum/agile. Coding. UI & visualisation design. Product prototyping and iteration. Team leadership.

It is small but, we like to think, close to perfectly formed. Our company is home to some of the best developers in the UK - not only in our opinion, but in the opinion of a number of international blue chip companies who use our development and research skills.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>LShift has been successfully delivering agile projects for blue-chip clients for more than 10 years. They are technology agnostic, preferring to use whatever best delivers business benefit.
Senior Developer is the only developer/architect role in the company, and is unique in that enormous freedom is given to own and direct all aspects of a project (from technical to client relationship), along with enormous responsibility to deliver. Given the exceptional caliber of the staff, this works well.</p><p>I joined LShift for the chance to work with such talent (and humour). I did learn a lot of technology, but the most important secret I learned was how to reliably deliver complex projects.
Technologies used so far: Clojure, Go, BigQuery, Scala, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, F#, Docker & Kubernetes, AWS, GCE/GKE, Hadoop, Spark, ElasticSearch, and many more.</p><ul><li>Projects have ranged from data-mining open NHS data to building highly secure messaging platforms.</li><li>Trained in <a href=http://www.dsdm.org/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">DSDM</a> agile project management.<br></li></ul><hr><br><figure><img src=/USydLogo.svg></figure><h2 id=research-fellow>Research Fellow<a class=anchor href=#research-fellow>#</a></h2><h3 id=university-of-sydneyhttpwwwusydeduau--sydney-australia><a href=http://www.usyd.edu.au target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">University of Sydney</a> | Sydney, Australia</h3><h3 id=may-2012--nov-2012>May 2012 – Nov 2012<a class=anchor href=#may-2012--nov-2012>#</a></h3><p>The <a href=http://chai.it.usyd.edu.au/ target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Computer Human Adapted Interaction</a> lab conducts research in <a href=http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/UbiHome.html target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">ubiquitous computing</a>. &ldquo;We are exploring the technical means by which people can make sense of what it means to ‘own’ and visualise their data in a digital world.
